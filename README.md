1. Compare kill time and trim to the shorter one
2. Compare cast count and show diffs
3. compare crits of casts and show diffs
4. Compute overall crit / dhit/ and crit dhit percentages
5. Show damage diff gained from crit
6. Check for hit counts on casts to compute padding diffs
7. I guess do some buff comparison as well idk what would be valuable there
